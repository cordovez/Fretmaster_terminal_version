# Fretmaster_terminal_version ðŸŽ¸

For those who may be interested in the intersection of coding and music learning; A point of departure for exploring the uses of technology to learn music concepts.

Feel free to clone this repo and expand on what I have done. To use, after you have cloned the files, simply navigate to the root of this file and run `python3 -m main`.

You will have the option of either printing a list of dictionaries containing fret information for a guitar, or playing a round of 10 guesses, to try to guess the scale position (7 positions as defined by Berklee).

This is kind of a departure point for an idea for an app, but there are many possibilities for expanding on what I have started, by using the notes in the dictionaries. You can produce different scales (think steps: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half).
